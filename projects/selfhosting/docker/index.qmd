## Why Do I use Docker?
I used to use a k8s cluster but I ended up spending more time managing k8s deployments and it became difficult to manage backups. I decided to simply things and went to docker over podman for the following reasons:  

- Developers often recommend docker compose for deployments
- Developers often provide ready-to-use docker-compose files
- A compose deployment can be easily backed up and migrated from host to host.

If I ever get a dedicated storage node and better networking hardware to build a SAN, I'll probably go back to k8s(more on this later).
