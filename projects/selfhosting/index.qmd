This is the wiki/documentation for my homelab and the services I selfhost.

## What is Self-Hosting?

Self-hosting is the practice of running and managing web apps, online tools, and other server applications yourself instead of using SaaS platforms.
For example, many people host media platforms, photo galleries, ad-blocking services, databases, and file sharing platforms.


## Why am I doing this:
Well first off, I just like this stuff. Working with computers is cool because you can tinker and break things and it doesn't matter because unlike physical machinery, software costs nothing to repair.

## What kind of services do I host on my servers?:
At the time of writing(2025-04-10), I don't run too many different services. Most of them can be roughly placed into the following categories:

- **Data & Development:** Data storage, orchestration, and reporting platforms; Git hosting and CI/CD 
- **Infrastructure:** SSO, VPN, monitoring, and mass storage plaftorms
- **Personal**: Password Managers, recipe databases, personal accounting software...


## What do I host in the cloud?:
Somethings are just better left to cloud providers. In my case:

### AWS
- DNS from Route53
- This website: S3 and CloudFront

### Azure
- Email from MS365
- Offsite Backups: Blob Storage

### Vultr
- Wireguard Relay Server
