title: Fedora Linux
draft: false
---

I chose Fedora as my standard distribution for a variety of reasons:

  - wide variety of up-to-date packages
  - default configuration is perfomative, secure, and usable(see [selinux](./selinux.qmd))
  - RHEL and Fedora familiy distros are very common in enterprise and academic spaces: computational programming packages will often often provide `.rpm` packages.
  - RHEL documentation is usually applicable
  - Provides a great cloud-init capable image for qemu based virtualization([proxmox](../proxmox/))
