title: Identity and Access Management
---


- I don't need active linux user management.  

Each linux host should have three users:
    - dhruv: private keys on ctl-01, use it as a jumpbox/workspace
    - svc_ctl: private keys on ctl-01 used for backups(eventually), cron jobs, ansible...
    - svc_forgejo: private key stored only in forgejo secrets, used for CI management

## People

- Each Person

- Each Person also gets a user group: for netbird personal devices


## Services
- Each service gets a service account
    - for mail and ldap binding

- linux services accounts should have passwordless sudo, and ssh keys

## Groups

- Admin: Administrative access

### Analysts
- grafana edit
- DB RO access

### Forgejo-users
- User Access to Forgejo: disable orgs

### Engineer
- RW on infrastructure stuff

### Family

### Friends
