title: Identity and Access Management
---


- I don't need active linux user management.  

Each linux host should have three static users:
    - dhruv: private keys on ctl-01, use it as a jumpbox/workspace
    - svc_ctl: private keys on ctl-01 used for backups, cron jobs, ansible...
    - svc_forgejo: private key stored only in forgejo secrets, used in CI/CD to deploy things

## People

- Each Person gets an authentik user

- Each Person also gets an authentik user group: for netbird [personal device policies](../services/netbird.qmd#personal-device-policies)


## Services
- Each service gets a service account
    - for mail and ldap binding

- linux services accounts should have passwordless sudo, and ssh keys

## Groups

- Admin: Administrative access

### Analysts
- grafana edit
- DB RO access

### Forgejo-users
- User Access to Forgejo: disable orgs

### Engineer
- RW on infrastructure stuff

### Family

### Friends
